## Introduction
In this project, it will be developed and explained the creation of an social media application/platform where an user can make post about a variety of topics, share multimedia files (images, videos, GIFs, among others), interact with other users from the app, while also having moderation and regulation from the content posted, in order to make a respectful and enjoyable space and make new users more comfortable when joining the app.
## Business Model
The main reason this app will be developed is to give the people another posting social media platform, while attempting to become superior in other spaces these social media platforms have failed. One of the main money income the app will get will be from ad revenue, another income would come from the collaboration between the app and different brands and companies. Most of the money will be redirected onto the app maintenance (app renovations, server maintenance, bug fixing, etc).
### Business Rules
- The users must be over 17 years of age
- Users must not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so.
- Users must not promote violence.
- Users may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent
